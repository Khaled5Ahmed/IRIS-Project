# Iris Flower Classification 


## Overview

##### This project utilizes a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on measurements of their petals and sepals. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which is commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks.



## Project Description


#### The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolour, or Virginica) based on these features.



## Deployment
