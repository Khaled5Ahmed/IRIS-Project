# Iris Flower Classification with SVC


## Overview

##### This project utilizes a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on measurements of their petals and sepals. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which is commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks.



## Project Description

### The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:
###### Sepal length (in cm)
###### Sepal width (in cm)
###### Petal length (in cm)
###### Petal width (in cm)

##### The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolour, or Virginica) based on these features.



## Features

#### Support Vector Classifier (SVC):
A machine learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate the data into different classes with the maximum margin.
#### Dataset: 
The Iris dataset used in this project.
